# @lusc/eslint-config

This is a collection of useful eslint configs and plugins.
It is meant to be used mainly with TypeScript and ESM.
Inspired by [xo](https://github.com/xojs/xo).

Use at your own risk!
This config is primarily intended to be used by me and my projects.
Any changes are likely breaking changes so any version bump can be breaking for you.
